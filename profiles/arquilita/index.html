He has been a consistent achiever since ever, up until now in college. He came from the renowned school in Southern Tagalog, Southern Luzon State University, and then moved to college in the University of the Philippines - Los Ba&ntilde;os. His hobbies include gaming (on which he plans to play competitively), watching series like animes and American/European shows, movie marathons with friends, listening to punk rock music, and creating works of art like sketches and publicity materials (he also plans to learn how to create digital art). His wish is to become an animator and/or a competitive gamer.
